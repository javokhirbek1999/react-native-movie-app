## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Cross-platform framework for building mobile apps.
- **TMDb API**: The Movie Database API to fetch movie and actor data.
- **AsyncStorage**: For storing liked movies and actors locally on the device.
- **React Navigation**: To handle app navigation.
- **Expo**: For building and running the app with ease.

## API Usage

This app uses the **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API to fetch movie and actor data. The API provides information such as:

- **Movie details**: Title, release date, genres, cast, and more.
- **Trending Movies**: A list of popular movies at the moment.
- **Upcoming Movies**: Movies that will be released soon.
- **Top-Rated Movies**: A list of movies with the highest ratings.
- **Actor details**: Actor bio, filmography, and profile images.

You can learn more about the TMDb API [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: If you haven't installed Expo CLI, install it globally using:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-app.git
   cd movie-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Once you've cloned the repository, install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up TMDb API Key**

   To interact with the TMDb API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

   - Go to [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
   - Sign up or log in to your account.
   - Navigate to your account settings and find the API section to generate your key.

   Once you have the API key, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

   ```
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Running the App**

   After setting up everything, start the app using Expo:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   This will start the development server. You can then open the app in the Expo Go app on your mobile device or use an Android/iOS simulator.
